# VisionBasedAircraftDAA

## Overview
This repository contains datasets, models, and simulators for the AVOIDDS benchmark which centers around the vision-based aircraft detect-and-avoid (DAA) problem. The full AVOIDDS dataset of 72,000 samples available here: [purl.stanford.edu/hj293cv5980](https://purl.stanford.edu/hj293cv5980).

## Primary Features
* [Dataset Generation](./src/data_generation/): generate large datasets for training and evaluating object detection model
* [Model Training](./src/model/): train custom detection models
* [Test Set Evaluation](./src/model/): evaluate models on a test set
* [Downstream Task Evaluation](./src/simulator/): evaluate models on simulated aircraft encounters

## Setting Up X-Plane
1. Download X-Plane 11: [Download Link](https://www.x-plane.com/desktop/try-it/older/)
2. Make sure you are running X-Plane 11.5+. If you are not, follow the prompts on X-Plane to update your version.
3. Download and configure X-Plane Connect: [Instructions Here](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect) (Make sure you download the file titled XPlaneConnect.zip)
4. In terminal, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.

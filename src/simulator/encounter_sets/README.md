# Encounter Sets

## Overview
Directory where encounters are stored after being generated by `encounter_model` directory. 

## Contents
* **[default_encounters.csv](./default_encounters.csv):** Default set of 500 encounters for experimentation
* **SET_NAME.csv:** Any other csvs in this directory are encounter sets that were generated using the `encounter_model` functionality. See the [encounter_model](../encounter_model/) README for information on how to generate encounters.

* **t:** Timestep within the encounter in seconds, beginning with 0 and counting up to the number of total timesteps in the encounter

Ownship Information
* **x0, y0, z0:** 3D coordinates of ownship in meters where the z-axis relates to altitude
* **v0:** Horizontal velocity of ownship in meters per second in the direction of the heading
* **dh0:** Vertical velocity of ownship in meters per second
* **theta0:** Heading of ownship in degrees

Intruder Information
* **x1, y1, z1:** 3D coordinates of intruder in meters where the z-axis relates to altitude
